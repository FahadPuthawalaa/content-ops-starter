          I hired Fahad Puthawala to optimize my new author site as I had little
          understanding of how to do this. Fahad gave me a very reasonable price
          for the work and it was done quickly. He also kept me informed along
          the way about the progress. I was happy after he had finished to get
          an email from google commenting on how much more traffic I was getting
          to my site. I really recommend Fahad. He is great to work with.

          I think Fahad is excellent at what he does. Not only that, but his
          commitment is really good. I recommend him to any who need his
          service.
