🧠 The Challenge

The brand wanted to dominate Amazon search results during a high-traffic season. Despite decent historical performance, they had yet to fully capitalize on Amazon’s ad ecosystem. The target was ambitious: significantly boost visibility, lower ACOS, and drive a sharp increase in new customer orders.



🎯 The Strategy

We built a robust full-funnel Amazon Ads strategy:

*   **Keyword Domination:** Aggressively targeted top-converting and competitor keywords using Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands.

*   **Product Display Ads:** Deployed Sponsored Display to retarget past viewers and cross-sell complementary items.

*   **ASIN-Level Optimization:** Focused spend on high-margin, high-converting products while pausing underperformers.

*   **Campaign Segmentation:** Created segmented campaigns by match type, product category, and buyer intent for better control and performance tracking.



💡 Key Campaign Elements

*   **Lightning Deals & Coupons:** Aligned ad pushes with promotional pricing to increase conversion rate.

*   **A+ Content Optimization:** Upgraded product pages with enhanced visuals and mobile-optimized content to increase time on page and trust.

*   **Brand Store Traffic:** Directed Sponsored Brand traffic to a well-designed Amazon Storefront showcasing top bundles and seasonal picks.



🚀 The Results

*   Ad Spend: $128,000+

*   ROAS: 420% (Amazon record for the brand)

*   Revenue: Over $537,000 in attributed Amazon sales

*   ACOS: Reduced by 20%

*   New-to-Brand Customers: 2000+



📌 Key Takeaways

*   Granular targeting on Amazon = massive scale with control

*   Coordinating deals with ad strategy supercharged conversions

*   A/B testing product listings led to stronger purchase intent
