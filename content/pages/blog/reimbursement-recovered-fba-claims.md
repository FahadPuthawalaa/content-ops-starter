> We partnered with a network of experienced Amazon FBA sellers managing multiple private-label brands across diverse product categories - ranging from electronics to pet supplements. Collectively, their annual revenue exceeded $10 million, and they relied heavily on Amazon's Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) network to handle logistics, warehousing, and shipping.

### **Challenge**

Despite robust sales, the sellers faced massive revenue leakage due to unclaimed or denied FBA reimbursements. Some of the key challenges included:

*   Lack of Visibility: Amazon’s complex reporting system made it difficult to identify where and when inventory was lost, damaged, or miscredited.

*   Manual Oversight: Most sellers lacked the in-house bandwidth or knowledge to monitor FBA reimbursements across their large inventory pool.

*   Time-Limited Claims: Many cases were slipping past the allowable claim windows due to delay in discovery or action.

*   Partial Reimbursements: Amazon would sometimes reimburse for only part of the value, leading to untracked losses.

*   Incorrect Weight/Dimension Fees: Sellers were unknowingly overcharged due to misclassified package sizes and weights.

***

### **Our Solution**

We implemented a 3-phase Reimbursement Recovery Strategy tailored to each seller:

#### Phase 1: Deep Data Audit & Identification

*   Conducted a 12-month FBA reimbursement audit across shipment, inventory adjustment, and return reports.

*   Used internal tools and manual review to flag discrepancies in:

    *   Lost or damaged inventory

    *   Returns not credited properly

    *   Overcharged FBA fees (due to incorrect dimensions or weights)

    *   Customer refund abuse or mismatches

#### Phase 2: Claims Filing & Dispute Management

*   Filed over 3,000 claims systematically across multiple seller accounts using customized case documentation.

*   Followed up persistently with Amazon Seller Support teams on delayed or partially reimbursed claims.

*   Refiled and escalated denied cases, with evidence-backed justifications to ensure compliance with Amazon’s reimbursement policy.

#### Phase 3: Ongoing Monitoring & Prevention

*   Set up a monthly reimbursement tracking system to prevent future claim expiration.

*   Trained seller teams on identifying and reporting potential reimbursement issues proactively.

*   Optimized SKU packaging data to reduce dimensional weight overcharges in future listings.

### **Results**

✅ $504,317 Recovered in total reimbursements to date

✅ Over 10,500 units reimbursed for lost/damaged inventory

✅ More than $62,000 in weight/dimension overcharges reversed

✅ 95% approval rate on all submitted claims

✅ 250+ expired claim cases prevented through early identification

***

**Conclusion**

This recovery not only improved the sellers’ bottom line but also highlighted the importance of consistent FBA audit management. Many sellers don’t realize how much Amazon “owes” them until a thorough audit is done.

If you’re an FBA seller handling more than 100 orders a day, there’s a good chance you’re leaving thousands of dollars on the table.
